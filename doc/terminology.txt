- A Result is a scalar with an associated name and units.

- A ResultSet is a list of Result objects and a name for the execution
  of that particular test.

- A Test runs some operation for an amount of time and returns a
  ResultSet.

- A GraphLine contains a title for the line and a list of ResultSet
  objects.

- A TestResult contains a test description, a system description, and a
  list of GraphLines.

- Tests* are Python scripts that use Benchmarks to build a TestResult,
  storing it in a file.

- Tests* can then generate graphs from the TestResult.

* Tests - Python tests are not to be confused (I know...) with the
  kind of Test that just measures a ResultSet.
