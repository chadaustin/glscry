How to Make a New GLScry Release
--

Run SCons with native Win32 Python, making sure you pass the right
path for the boostIncludes option.  For me, the command looks
something like:

        sconsw boostIncludes=D:/Projects/pyrallis/glscry/third-party/vc7/Boost/include

GLScry has a distutils script that generates the actual distribution.
Once again, here is the command on my system:

       C:/Python24/python setup.py py2exe

Now you should have a 'dist' directory that you can just zip up and
distribute.  :)  If you get errors, send us an e-mail.
